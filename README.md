2. The app will be developed using “Stacked” architecture.

3. Support different localization (English / Chinese / your language of choice etc.)

4. Show “Platform specific widgets” for things like loading indicator, dialog popup, action sheets. (Using Flutter platform widget package)

5. Font size will scale according to the device's accessibility setting “font size”.
